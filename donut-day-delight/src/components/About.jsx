      <h2>About National Donut Day</h2>
      <p>
        National Donut Day is celebrated on the first Friday of June every year.
        It was started in 1938 by The Salvation Army to honor their members who
        served donuts to soldiers during World War I.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, it's a fun and flavorful holiday enjoyed across the U.S., with
        many donut shops offering free or discounted donuts to customers.
